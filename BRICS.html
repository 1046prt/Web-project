    <b><p class="intro"> <strong>BRICS:</strong>It is an intergovernmental organization that has evolved
         into a cohesive geopolitical bloc, with their governments meeting annually at
    formal summits and coordinating multilateral policies since 2009.</p></b>
    <p class="body">
    Nearly three dozen countries are seeking entry into the China and Russia-backed BRICS economic group, member state South Africa said Wednesday, weeks 
    after the body expanded its membership for the first time in more than a decade.
    <br><br>
    Thirty-four countries have submitted an expression of interest in joining the bloc of major emerging economies, South African Foreign Minister Naledi 
    Pandor told reporters, without naming the nations.
    <br><br>
    Russia was accepting those applications after assuming rotating chairmanship of the group this year – and will be the first member to oversee the body 
    since it significantly expanded its global footprint at the start of the year, when Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Ethiopia, and 
    Egypt formally joined.
    <br><br>
    The growing membership is widely viewed as a win for China and Russia, which have sought to reshape an international system they see as unfairly 
    dominated by the United States amid growing frictions with Washington and the West.
    <br><br>
    BRICS, which since 2011 had been made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, roughly positions itself as the Global South’s answer
    to the Group of Seven (G7) major developed economies.
   <br><br>
   China has been a key driver of its expansion as leader Xi Jinping pushes an alternative world order, forging closer partnerships with key global
   players from Russia to the Middle East and strengthening international bodies where Beijing holds sway.
   <br><br>
   The expansion and continued interest from dozens more countries are also a boon for Russia, which has been shunned economically and diplomatically 
   by the West following its invasion of Ukraine.
   <br><br>
   Moscow’s position as chair will be a key opportunity for Russian President Vladimir Putin to push back against that isolation and portray himself as a key player on a broad diplomatic stage, as world leaders typically travel to the host nation for an annual summit.  
   Last year, all member state leaders besides Putin gathered in person in Johannesburg. <br><br>The Russian president, who has an International Criminal Court warrant out for his arrest linked to alleged war crimes in Ukraine, participated virtually. <br>
  <br>This year’s event is expected to take place in October in the southwestern Russian city of Kazan.
   Earlier this year, Putin encouraged representatives “of all countries interested in cooperating with our organization” to take part in events and said Russia looked forward to “working productively with all countries in the BRICS orbit,” according to state-run news agency Tass.
